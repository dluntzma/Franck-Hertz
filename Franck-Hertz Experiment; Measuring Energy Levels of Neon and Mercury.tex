\section{Results}

\subsection{Neon}

We did four data runs using neon. For each run we recorded the accelerating voltage (x data) and the electron current measured by the anode, this current was recorded as a voltage measured across an internal resister. Each of our runs showed three discernible minima in the voltage corresponding to electron current, see the sample data run Figure~\ref{neon_data}. These dips are the voltages just before the electrons have enough energy (from the accelerating voltage) to reach the anode even after an inelastic collision with a neon atom. The apparent double minima, see the second and third dips in Figure~\ref{neon_data}, is most likely caused by by energy levels with very similar excitation energies.~\cite{newfeatures} Also of interest is the voltage corresponding to the steepest negative slope which is when the majority of electrons have enough energy to cite the neon atoms. However the location of the steepest negative slope was difficult to determine from our data, again see Figure~\ref{neon_data}.

\label{neon_data}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Mercury}

Since the number of discernible dips for mercury depends on temperature, we collected data for 10$^{\circ}$C increments starting at 150$^{\circ}$C and ranging to 210$^{\circ}$C. From this data, see Figure~\ref{hg_data}, it can be seen that there is an optimum temperature at around 200$^{\circ}$C at which the most minima can be observed. 

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering

\includegraphics[width=6in]{hg_data.pdf}
\caption{Mercury data for temperatures ranging from 150$^{\circ}$C to 210$^{\circ}$C. The range of temperatures shows the optimum temperature to be approximately 190 - 200$^{\circ}$C. For higher temperatures, such as 210$^{\circ}$C, the minima in electron current are not discernible. For lower temperatures, for example 150$^{\circ}$C and 160$^{\circ}$C, there were fewer minima before the mercury atoms ionized.}

\label{hg_data}
\end{figure}

Using the information that we obtained about the optimum range of temperature, we took a more data using a lock-in. With the lock-in we took data from 185$^{\circ}$C to 215$^{\circ}$C in increments of 5$^{\circ}$C. The output from the lock-in, see Figure~\ref{hg_lockin}, is the derivative of the output without the lock-in. Therefore, the minima in the lock-in output correspond to the steepest negative slope of the direct output and the places the lock-in data passes through zero correspond to the minima and maxima of the direct output. The lock-in detector was highly sensitive to ionization of the mercury atoms. Our 185$^{\circ}$C data already showed significant reduction in the number of minima because of ionization. Because of space considerations we are not showing all of our lock-in data. Figure~\ref{hg_lockin} is the data collected for 205$^{\circ}$C and is a representative sample of the data collected.

\section{Analysis}

\subsection{Neon}

To determine the energy needed to excite the neon atoms we needed to find the spacing of the minima in electron current (which we measured as a voltage.) We visually determined the locations of the minima and the steepest negative slopes with uncertainty for each of our data runs, see sample data in Figure~\ref{neon_data}. We then calculated the change in voltage between adjacent minima and between adjacent steepest slopes. These values can be seen in Table~\ref{neon_dvs}.

\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\caption{ }
\begin{ruledtabular}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c}
$\Delta$V Minima & Error $\Delta$V Minima & $\Delta$V Steepest Slope &  Error $\Delta$V Steepest Slope\\
\hline	% horizontal line to separate headings from data
19.0 & 2.0 & 19.2 & 1.5  \\
16.4 & 2.0 & 19.5 & 1.5  \\
18.5 & 1.3 & 20.0 & 2.5  \\
17.6 & 1.6 & 18.5 & 2.5  \\
18.4 & 1.2 & 19.5 & 2.0  \\
17.0 & 1.5 & 18.8 & 2.0  \\
18.5 & 1.5 & 18.5 & 2.5  \\
17.5 & 2.5 & 19.5 & 2.0  \\

\end{tabular}
\end{ruledtabular}
\label{neon_dvs}
\end{table}

We then averaged these values and got 17.9 $\pm$ .3 eV as the average difference between the minima where the uncertainty is the standard deviation of the mean. From the difference between the steepest slopes we got an average value of 19.19 $\pm$ .19 eV. If we then average these two values, we get a final value of 18.5 $\pm$ .4 eV where uncertainty is again the standard deviation of the mean. This value agrees with our expectations because neon has a large number of transitions with energies ranging from 18.3 eV to 18.9 eV.

\subsection{Mercury}

Because the shape of our mercury data was highly dependent on temperature, the process by which we found the energy level was more involved. We began our analysis in a similar way to our analysis of neon by visually determining the location of the minima and steepest negative slope. However, when we calculated the difference in voltage between minima this method gave us an uncertainty on the order of 10$\%$. We then plotted the distance between minima versus the minima number as suggested by Rapior, Sengstock and Baev~\cite{newfeatures} and fit linear lines to the data for each temperature. Rapior, Sengstock and Baev found that the fit lines from each temperature converged toward the minima number .5. We found that the fit lines to our data did not converge at dip number .5, see Figure~\ref{hg_direct_plot}, furthermore the uncertainty for our minima was large enough to make our results imprecise and unsatisfying.

To improve our results, we used that data collected using the lock-in detector. Because the lock-in output is the derivative of the direct output it is the x intercept with a positive slope that corresponds to the minima in the direct data and the minima of the lock-in output corresponds to the steepest negative slopes of the direct output. Figure~\ref{rel_error} shows the data points from the direct output steepest slope and minima and the corresponding lock-in outputs (minima and positive slope x-intercept) for 200$^{\circ}$C.

\begin{figure}[h!]

\includegraphics[width=6in]{rel_error.pdf}
\caption{All the 200$^{\circ}$C data shown with the relative errors. The blue data is the steepest negative slope from the direct data and the corresponding lock-in minima data. The lock-in data has less than half the error of the direct data. The red data is the direct output minima and the lock-in positive x-intercepts. The lock-in positive x-intercepts had the least uncertainty.}

\label{rel_error}
\end{figure}


 The data with the least uncertainty was that data from the lock-in using the positive x intercepts to calculate the differences in voltage. From this data we found the values seen in Table~\ref{hg_lockin_table}.

\end{figure}

Following the analysis outlined by Rapior, Sengstock and Baev, we used our fit lines to extrapolate to the voltages corresponding to a minima number of .5. Averaging these values gave us 4.46 $\pm$ .12 V where the uncertainty is the standard deviation of the mean. The results obtained from all of our mercury data are in Table~\ref{hg_results}, not the much larger uncertainties for the direct output data and lock-in data were we locked at the minima.

\caption{A summary of the best values and uncertainties from each of our data sets. All of these values, except the lock-in positive x-intercept value, agree with the expected energy value for mercury transitions.}

\end{tabular}
\end{ruledtabular}
\label{hg_results}
\end{table}

Averaging the best values from each set of data, from Table~\ref{hg_results}, we got a final value of 4.56 $\pm$ .4 V. This value agrees with the known value of the lowest excitation $6^{1}S_{0}$ to $6^{3}P_{0}$ (4.67 eV) of mercury and also with the second excitation $6^{1}S_{0}$ to $6^{3}P_{1}$ (4.89 eV.)~\cite{newfeatures}

\section{Discussion}

All of our data was consistent with our expectations based on theory and past experiments. We were able to see the drops in electron current at regular intervals as electron gained enough energy to excite the neon or mercury atoms. For mercury, we saw that there was an optimal temperature range when drops in electron current were maximized in number and still discernible in amplitude. As suggested by Rapior,  Sengstock, and Baev, the difference in voltage between our minima tended to increase as the number of the minimum increased. 

Our final values for the energy needed to excite mercury show a stark trade off of accuracy versus precision. Our direct data values have a very large uncertainty (10 - 15$\%$), see Table~\ref{hg_results} so they are not very precise, but they are accurate. Whereas our lock-in x-intercept data has a much smaller uncertainty (~2.7$\%$) a much higher precision, but it is no longer accurate because it is not in agreement with the known value of the excitation energy.

One of the biggest limitations in our experiment was our uncertainty in the precise voltages corresponding to the minima and steepest slopes. Particularly for the lock-in data, but also for the direct data, our uncertainty was largely based on the resolution of our graphs. The direct output data used the power supply that came with the apparatus, it had a resolution of 0.1 V. For the lock-in data we used an independent power supply that also increased the accelerating voltage in increments of 0.1 V. These increments of 0.1 V gave us an uncertainty on that order of magnitude and set a lower limit on our uncertainty. If we had increased the accelerating voltage in increments of 0.01 V, we would have had better resolution of our data and less uncertainty in our analysis. 

\section{Conclusion}

18.5 $\%$ .4 V, the value we got for the neon excitation energy, is in agreement with a large number of excitation energies for neon between 18.3 - 18.9 V. We were not able determine the energy transitions more precisely from the data that we collected. With our apparatus we were only able to obtain three minima before the neon ionized. Using other equipment we might be able to obtain more data and calculate the transition more precisely.

Our final value for mercury energy transitions was 4.56 $\pm$ .4 V which agrees with the known values for both the lowest energy transition, 4.67 eV, and the next lowest energy transition, 4.89 eV. We would hope for a more precise answer that would correspond with just one of the energy transitions. However, the resolution of our data was restricted by the apparatus we used.

It is possible that a most sensitive measurement of electron current we could have seen more minima below the first minima that we could detect. Having more minima would increase the number of data points used to fit lines and extrapolate the transition energy. Since some of our fit lines were made with only a couple of data points, increasing the number of points would help to average out outliners that are undiscernable with only a few points. 

Despite our difficulty in precisely determining the excitation energy of mercury, the overall results of this experiment are still as fascinating as they were for Franck and Hertz. This experiment clearly shows that electrons must have a certain quantified amount of energy before they can excite atoms. This result supports the premise of quantum mechanics and makes an abstract theory more tangible.
